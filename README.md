# CryptoQuest
This is a desktop GUI game programmed in Java. It uses Java core libraries for all the functionalities and Java Swing for the GUI. It also uses the Java networking library to allow multiple users to play at once, when connected locally.


It is a cyber version of the board game, Scotland Yard. 


P.S - I made this a long time ago, so the code might not be very clean. There will be a lot of duplication in the code.
